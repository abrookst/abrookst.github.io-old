          <p>Hello! Welcome to my first blogpost!</p>
          <br>
          <p>Today, I would like to talk about the metaverse. As the weather cools, and fall comes, the "hype" around the metaverse has seemingly waned. I am seeing less and less articles about a <a href="">metaverse fashion show</a> or how The Oscars made <a href="">Chadwick Boseman into an NFT</a>. This can be pretty easily seen in the google trends, where "NFT", "Crypto", and "Metaverse" are sitting at an all time low. </p>

          <p style="size: 8">google trends for "crypto"</p>
          <br>
          <p>This was honestly inevitable, in more ways than one. Trying to muscle in the new wave of technology with raw acquisitions, money, and hype leads to nothing but a fad. The brighter the star shines, the quicker it burns out. But I do not believe that the metaverse is a fad, and no matter how critical I am of NFTs, I believe it and the blockchain has its place.</p>
          <br>
          <p>As a resident VR dweller, I have seen some of the magic that can come of this virtual world we have crafted. Some of the interactions and experiences I have had in/with XR have been amazing, and really unforgettable. Whether that was the first time I put on an Oculus, back in 2016, and being blown away by the worlds I was taken to, or when I caught my first Pokemon in Pokemon GO, and being amazed at how the pokemon seemed to be right there. We have come a long way, and these technologies have been implemented into our daily lives. I use AR with Google Maps every day, and VR is being used in industries across the world. It is not a fad or some sort of trend, and the immediate next step is to make our little demos and experiences into entire worlds. To take that "world" and turn it into a "universe." </p>
          <br>
          <p>But again, these technologies that have become mainstream were not started in huge multi-billion dollar marketing pushes. They were made by people with a vision and a passion. Sure John Carmack had a hand in Oculus&#39; origin, but Oculus did not have a conference room full of investors waiting for this whole "VR" thing they spent a lot of money investing in. The money came from the community, via Kickstarter. And that's how I believe the metaverse will be made, by those who want to see it done, and it does not have to be done by Q3 2022. </p>
          <br>
          <p>And we almost had it, we almost had that lovingly made community metaverse, with an application called Neos VR, but as ThrillSeeker pointed out in a fantastic video, the hype behind the future of tech is what killed the most advanced VR application we have seen to date.</p>

          <br>
          <p>All I can hope for is that this doesn't become the next Virtual Boy, that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/teens-are-split-on-the-metaverse-most-barely-use-vr-headsets-survey-shows/">the uphill struggle</a> we are already facing to move the metaverse and VR forward wasn't just worsened by a rich visionary at the top of their game once again. To quote Kotaku about Facebook&#39;s Metaverse Application "Horizon":</p>
          <br>
          <p>"Horizon is not quite as awful as the ad makes it seem, but it is still a hollow, corporate shell that has more in common with an office than it does a playground, or any other type of social space a human being would willingly want to hang out in. It&#39;s definitely no VRchat or Rec Room."</p>
          <br>
          <p>And I wholeheartedly believe that this should not be all the metaverse has to offer. And I hope another project like Neos comes around to show us how the Metaverse should actually be done.</p>
